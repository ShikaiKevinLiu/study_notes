A golden rule in programming is that:

​	**code does not do what you expect it to do, but what you tell it to do.** 

Bridging that gap can sometimes be a quite difficult feat. In this lecture we are going to cover useful techniques for dealing with buggy and resource hungry code: debugging and profiling.

## Debugging

### Printf debugging and Logging

-- The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements” — Brian Kernighan, *Unix for Beginners*.

A first approach to debug a program is to add print statements around where you have detected the problem, and keep iterating until you have extracted enough information to understand what is responsible for the issue.

A second approach is to use **logging** in your program, instead of ad hoc print statements. Logging is better than regular print statements for several reasons:

- You can log to files, sockets or even remote servers instead of standard output.
- Logging supports **severity levels** (such as INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, &c), that allow you to filter the output accordingly.
- For new issues, there’s a fair chance that your logs will contain enough information to detect what is going wrong.

## Analysis

For some issues you do not need to run any code. For example, just by carefully looking at a piece of code you could realize that your loop variable is shadowing an already existing variable or function name; or that a program reads a variable before defining it. Here is where [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) tools come into play. Static analysis programs take source code as input and analyze it using coding rules to reason about its correctness.

In the following Python snippet there are several mistakes. First, our loop variable `foo` shadows the previous definition of the function `foo`. We also wrote `baz` instead of `bar` in the last line, so the program will crash after completing the `sleep` call (which will take one minute).
