## Entropy

[Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) is a measure of randomness. This is useful, for example, when determining the strength of a password.

## Hash Function

A [cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed size, and has some special properties. A rough specification of a hash function is as follows:

```bash
hash(value: array<byte>) -> vector<byte, N>  (for some fixed N)
```

An example of a hash function is [SHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1), which is used in Git. It maps arbitrary-sized inputs to 160-bit outputs (which can be represented as 40 hexadecimal characters). We can try out the SHA1 hash on an input using the `sha1sum` command:

```bash
$ printf 'hello' | sha1sum
aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d
$ printf 'hello' | sha1sum
aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d
$ printf 'Hello' | sha1sum 
f7ff9e8b7bb2e09b70935a5d785e0cc5d9d0abf0
```

At a high level, a hash function can be thought of as a hard-to-invert random-looking (but deterministic) function (and this is the [ideal model of a hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_oracle)). A hash function has the following properties:

- **Deterministic**: the same input always generates the same output.
- **Non-invertible**: it is hard to find an input `m` such that `hash(m) = h` for some desired output `h`.
- **Target collision resistant**: given an input `m_1`, it’s hard to find a different input `m_2` such that `hash(m_1) = hash(m_2)`.
- **Collision resistant**: it’s hard to find two inputs `m_1` and `m_2` such that `hash(m_1) = hash(m_2)` (note that this is a strictly stronger property than target collision resistance).

Note: while it may work for certain purposes, SHA-1 is [no longer](https://shattered.io/) considered a strong cryptographic hash function. You might find this table of [lifetimes of cryptographic hash functions](https://valerieaurora.org/hash.html) interesting. However, note that recommending specific hash functions is beyond the scope of this lecture. If you are doing work where this matters, you need formal training in security/cryptography.



### Applications

- Git, for content-addressed storage. The idea of a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) is a more general concept (there are non-cryptographic hash functions). Why does Git use a cryptographic hash function?
- A short summary of the contents of a file. Software can often be downloaded from (potentially less trustworthy) mirrors, e.g. Linux ISOs, and it would be nice to not have to trust them. The official sites usually post hashes alongside the download links (that point to third-party mirrors), so that the hash can be checked after downloading a file.
- [Commitment schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme). Suppose you want to commit to a particular value, but reveal the value itself later. For example, I want to do a fair coin toss “in my head”, without a trusted shared coin that two parties can see. I could choose a value `r = random()`, and then share `h = sha256(r)`. Then, you could call heads or tails (we’ll agree that even `r` means heads, and odd `r` means tails). After you call, I can reveal my value `r`, and you can confirm that I haven’t cheated by checking `sha256(r)` matches the hash I shared earlier.

## Key derivation functions

A related concept to cryptographic hashes, [key derivation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function) (KDFs) are used for a number of applications, including producing fixed-length output for use as keys in other cryptographic algorithms. Usually, KDFs are deliberately slow, in order to slow down offline brute-force attacks.

### Applications

- Producing keys from passphrases for use in other cryptographic algorithms (e.g. symmetric cryptography, see below).
- Storing login credentials. Storing plaintext passwords is bad; the right approach is to generate and store a random [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) `salt = random()` for each user, store `KDF(password + salt)`, and verify login attempts by re-computing the KDF given the entered password and the stored salt.

## Symmetric cryptography

Hiding message contents is probably the first concept you think about when you think about cryptography. Symmetric cryptography accomplishes this with the following set of functionality:

```
keygen() -> key  (this function is randomized)

encrypt(plaintext: array<byte>, key) -> array<byte>  (the ciphertext)
decrypt(ciphertext: array<byte>, key) -> array<byte>  (the plaintext)
```

The encrypt function has the property that given the output (ciphertext), it’s hard to determine the input (plaintext) without the key. The decrypt function has the obvious correctness property, that `decrypt(encrypt(m, k), k) = m`.

An example of a symmetric cryptosystem in wide use today is [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).

### Applications

- Encrypting files for storage in an untrusted cloud service. This can be combined with KDFs, so you can encrypt a file with a passphrase. Generate `key = KDF(passphrase)`, and then store `encrypt(file, key)`.
